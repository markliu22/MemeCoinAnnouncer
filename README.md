## Introduction
It seems I'm always late to hear about these celebrity meme coins. By the time I hear about them, it's already too late.
It would be nice to know about them right when they're announced without constantly checking online. This way, I can buy and sell a little bit before any potential rug pull.

This app monitors tweets from the most popular X (Twitter) users and notifies subscribers via email/text if the tweet contains an announcement of a new cryptocurrency (looking for $TOKEN patterns).
